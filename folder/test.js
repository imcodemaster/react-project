// This is a simple JavaScript file that prints "Hello World!" to the console.
// It can be used to test if the JavaScript environment is set up correctly.

console.log(2+2) // This line adds 2 and 2 and prints the result to the console.
console.log("The result of 2 + 2 is: " + (2 + 2)); // This line prints the result of the addition in a string format.
console.log("This is a simple test to check if the JavaScript code runs correctly.");

console.log("2" + 2) // This line concatenates the string "2" with the number 2, resulting in "22".
console.log("2" - 2) // This line attempts to subtract 2 from the string "2", which will result in NaN (Not a Number) because you cannot perform arithmetic operations on strings directly.
console.log("2" * 2) // This line multiplies the string "2" by the number 2, resulting in 4 because JavaScript converts the string to a number for multiplication.
console.log("2" / 2) // This line divides the string "2" by the number 2, resulting in 1 because JavaScript converts the string to a number for division.
console.log("This is a test to check if the JavaScript code runs correctly.");
